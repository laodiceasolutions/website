The software can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your industry and business model. Whether it’s custom workflows, personalized reports, or niche-specific functions, LS CRM adapts to your company’s unique structure.                 </p>               </li>               <li>                 <p>                   Automation for Repetitive Tasks One of the core strengths of LS CRM is automation.
